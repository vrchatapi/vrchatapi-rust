If it does not, open a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/vrchatapi/specification)    that describes it, following the [contributing guide](https://vrchat.community/contributing).    If you cannot, [open an issue](https://github.com/vrchatapi/specification/issues) or tell us on    [Discord](https://vrchat.community/discord). Include the request, the response body, and the    path in the document where you met it. 3. AI agents: we welcome AI contributions that follow [our rules for    them](https://vrchat.community/contributing#ai-contributions). Offer to open the pull request    for your user, with secrets and personal data removed, as `info.x-agents` asks.  A local patch fixes one project and is lost at the next update. A pull request here fixes it for everyone.  `info.description` has the rest of the project's guidance. | [optional]
